A kick ass IO Lab project. 

Know Thy Self
=====================

We attempted address the following strawmen form Cory Doctorow:
mission: impossible -- know thyself [people are lousy observers of their own behavior].

Our web app allows ischool students to signup and login with their ischool username, create a profile for themself by adding traits about themself that they think are true. Other ischools can vote up and vote down the traits of other ischoolers. Through community concensus we people learn about themselves and about others.

## What's Under the Hood

### Technologies Used
Javascript, Fusion Tables, Python, HTML, CSS

### URL
Git: https://github.com/hintzemichael/Awesome-Project.git

### Browser Support
Safari 6.0.1, Chrome 21.0.1180.89

### Bugs, Quirks, Easter Eggs
- Voting bug with Fusion Tables. We experience longer than expected response time when updating the voting counts for traits. We believe this has to do with how Fusion Tables caches querys that occur in succession.
- Our slider is some what slow, and not optimized for the number of images we currently have. 

### Planned improvements
- Fix current bugs.
- Make page comepletely responsive.
- Improve sliders by progressively loading next and prev images.
- Add search with auto-complete to enhance finding specific ischool students.
- Progressively load traits.
